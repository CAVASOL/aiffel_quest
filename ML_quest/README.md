## ML Node

### 2-3. Data Handling

```
Practice for data preprocessing including data deletion, missing value processing,  
sorting, data type conversion, use of built-in functions, grouping, apply function, etc. through Pandas.  
```

### 4. Scikit-learn

```
From data preprocessing to machine learning model training  
and evaluation using Scikit-Learn  
``` 

### 5. Supervised learning - Classfication

```
Practice classification machine learning models, evaluate the base model,  
and briefly perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.  
``` 

### 6. Supervised learning - Regression

```
Practice regression machine learning models.  
Compare with a model that applies regulation to linear regression  
and automatically search for hyperparameters to apply to the xgboost model.  
```

### 7. Unsupervised Learning

```
PCA, a representative method of dimensionality reduction, and various PCA methods.  
k-means clustering, a non-hierarchical cluster analysis, and dendlegram, a hierarchical cluster analysis.  
```

### 8. NLP, Natural Language Processing

```
Adapting machine learning based on unstructured data, i.e. natural language.  
```

### 9. DL, Deep Learning

```
Classifying simple unstructured data (images) with deep learning (TensorFlow)  
```
